1.) A token is a unique series of letters and number specificto a user. A piece of data that is a vital player on its own terms. This is stored in a a server for that users authentication. This can be stored locally to the users local storage for easy access to that same website .

2). Making sure we have https on our web applications. Making sure that all tokens are secure and private to each user.

3). a web server will p rocess incoming network request over HTTP and many other protocols. The main fucntion of a web server is to store, process and deliever all web pages to the user/client calling for it. The bridge between the client and the server is called HTTP(HyperText-transfer-Protcol)

4). You have .get which calls an api fr data and you can render that to your applications UI.

.post is another with you can add data to an server and render that same information to the UI as well.

.put allows you to edit state that is stored in the server
